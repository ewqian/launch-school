Q: Sometimes, the documentation is going to leave you scratching your head.

In a very early assignment at Launch School, you are tasked with writing a program that loads some text messages from a YAML file. We do this with YAML::load_file:

```
require 'yaml'
MESSAGES = YAML.load_file('calculator_messages.yml')
```

Find the documentation for YAML::load_file.

A:
https://ruby-doc.org/3.2.0/stdlibs/yaml/YAML.html
The third sentence says 'YAML module is an alias of PSych, the YAML engine for Ruby.' This directs us to the Psych module which has the ::load_file method.
