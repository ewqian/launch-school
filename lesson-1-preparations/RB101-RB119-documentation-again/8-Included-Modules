Q: Use irb to run the following code:

```
a = [5, 9, 3, 11]
puts a.min
```

Find the documentation for the #min method and change the above code to print the two smallest values in the Array.

A:
https://ruby-doc.org/3.2.0/Array.html#method-i-min
puts a.min(2) => [3, 5]  # returns minimum-valued elements in ascending order
